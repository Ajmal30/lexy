# Welcome to Lexy

## About

**Lexy** is a lightweight CLI tool that fetches programming tutorials from [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com) directly into your terminal. Quickly search, learn, and reference code examples without leaving your workflow.

Lexy saves a local copy of the documentation, so you can access it even when you're offline. It also provides syntax highlighting using [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) and fuzzy search using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

This project would not be possible without the amazing work of the [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://github.com/adambard/learnxinyminutes-docs) community. A huge thanks to all contributors for making high-quality learning resources freely available!
